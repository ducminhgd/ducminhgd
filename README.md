<summary><b>How to work with me</b></summary>

## Values

1. I value *transparency*, *trust*, *integrity,* and *honesty*.
2. I value and welcome *diversity of thought*. There is no stupid idea or stupid question, we are better to discuss all the possible opinions, ideas than to ignore them.
3. I value *creating values,* aka your contributions as individuals or as a team. My success are defined as the successes of three factors: individual, my team, the organization. Besides, the customers or the stakeholders don’t care about our team or our organization, they just care about the values that we bring to them.

## Work

### Individual

1. To me, the *work-life balance* means working is a part of my life. I’m working hard to achieve other goals of my wonderful life, and I believe you’re doing the same. Contributing to work is contributing for life, that’s my style, I don’t require you to do the same.
2. I would like to work in the office where I can communicate with my wonderful colleagues. My working hours should be 9am-6pm, and 10pm to 00am. Weekends, I can work remote if it is necessary.
3. I often ask people for status of tasks or works because I would like to get shit done. If everything is in good progress, just give me a time point, I will comeback later. And, I’m asking you to do the same to me, push me, sometimes I forget somethings.
4. I’m achieving to build self-managed teams, which can work with high ownership, high responsibility, and high proactiveness.
5. There are three stages: *make it work*, *make it right*, *make it better*. I would like to go from stage two to stage three. When you make it right, and there is something wrong, we will know what’s wrong.
6. <this will be updated by you>

### Team

1. I’m not the best but I can help us the best.
2. I don’t care when you work or off, soon or late, it’s your time. Please be on time for meetings and deadlines, because it’s our time.
3. I would like to be a servant leader, I empower and enable the team, build trust, clear fogs. You can involve me in any discussions to learn things and to back you up.
4. There is nothing in the team that only one person knows (*transparency*). Team should backup for each individual. Please send messages in a group or channel, I don’t encourage direct messages.
5. All the mistakes or faults are no need to find the actor, no one would like to know and they don’t need to know. Problems are need to find the root cause to solves. The actor is always me.
6. I expect we have at least a half day per week or 30 mins per day to discuss about the new knowledge that we learnt in every fields.
7. Discussions, meetings should be noted and documents have to be updated.
8. If you need my help, please let me know. Sometimes, I don’t proactively help others even if there is a issue and people don’t raise for my action, I **trust** you can overcome it.
9. Your leave balance should be negative (if your tasks are in good progress). Money can be re-earned, time and health cannot. And, **trust** your teammates, they can cover you.

## Communication style

I’m achieving for the success of the team, I communicate with honesty and caring. English is my second language, and I often go straight for what I’m thinking, I don’t offense but I may miss subtlety.

You can contact me anytime, I will response as soon as possible, even on my leaves or at midnights.

When we miscommunicated, or misunderstood, please overcommunicate. I do not know if you do not tell me about.

I appreciate [anonymous feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHJ070rRIfWlry5qEv6adFnE9nY1DoEIzLiXE4S_Bl9p6oNA/viewform), or meet in person (a 1-1 meeting or a coffee chat is still OK).

Finally, please **trust** me that I mature enough to receive your feedback and to resolve the conflicts, the problems. I will do the same.
